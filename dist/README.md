A Python/Qt application that visualizes and edits the results from spike sorting of Omniplex-recorded
data in the Lisberger lab.

## Background
TODO

## Installation (for MacOS/Linux)
- Ensure that Python 3.11+ is installed on your system. We currently build the package against
version 3.11.4.
- Download the wheel file `xsort-x.y.z-py3-none-any.whl`, where `x.y.x` is the release version number.
- In a terminal console, navigate to the directory holding the wheel file you downloaded, and install 
the package: `pip install xsort-x.y.z-py3-none-any.whl`.
- To start the app: `python -m xsort.app`.
