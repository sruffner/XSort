## License
**XSort** was created by [Scott Ruffner](mailto:sruffner@srscicomp.com). It is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.

## Credits
Based on a program developed by David J. Herzfeld, who provided critical guidance and feedback during the
development of **XSort**. Developed with funding provided by the Stephen G. Lisberger laboratory in the Department of
Neuroscience at Duke University.

In addition to the Python standard library, the `XSort` user interface is built upon the Qt for Python framework, 
[PySide6](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/index.html), data analysis routines employ the [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) 
and [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) libraries, and graphical plots are drawn using [PyQtGraph](https://pyqtgraph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
